Make a Pull Request review, getting the changes from the current branch compared to the main one.

## Guidelines

Look for:

- Bugs
- Typos
- Security flaws
- Performance issues
- Premature optimizations that makes the code more difficult to read
- Opportunities to make the code simpler and easier to understand

## Output

- List identified issues, never changing the code
