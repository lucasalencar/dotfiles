# Emacs TODO

- tick+N binding to move project closer
- Rename workspaces with current project name automatically
- Fn that loads current buffer and run ns tests (kokada has an example)
- Show flycheck warnings/errors in the echo line (not in the middle of the code)
- Show indicator that repl is opening
- Start repl automatically when project is opened
- Show indicator that file is being evaled
- Handle eval for form under cursor (#'cider-eval-sexp-at-point is not an option)
- Use C-o/C-i to go back and forward cursor position (#'evil-jump-back is weird)
- Solution for tabs in emacs that does not suck
- After using project find with SPC-*, allow to filter by another search (like fzf in vim)
- Find a better term alternatives
- Start using nudev emacs config for better alignments
- Request gpg key inside emacs when commiting
- Use tab to autocomplete suggestions popup
- Eval files after saving them
