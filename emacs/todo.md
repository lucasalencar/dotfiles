# Emacs TODO

- [x] C-letters navigation between panels
- [ ] tick+N binding to move project closer
- [ ] Rename workspaces with current project name automatically
- [ ] Fn that loads current buffer and run ns tests
- [ ] Show flycheck besides line numbers
- [ ] Show flycheck warnings/errors in the modeline (not in the middle of the code)
- [ ] Simplify modeline to show fewer information
- [ ] Show indicator that repl is opening
- [ ] Show indicator that file is being evaled
- [ ] Handle eval for form under cursor (#'cider-eval-sexp-at-point is not an option)
- [ ] Add form motion (daf, caf)
- [ ] Use C-o/C-i to go back and forward cursor position (#'evil-jump-back is weird)
- [ ] Solution for tabs in emacs that does not suck
- [ ] After using project find with SPC-*, allow to filter by another search (like fzf in vim)
