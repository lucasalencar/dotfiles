# Emacs TODO

- tick+N binding to bring project closer to next workspace
- tick+P binding to bring project closer to previous workspace
- Show flycheck warnings/errors in the echo line (not in the middle of the code)
- Show indicator that repl is opening
- Start repl automatically when project is opened
- Show indicator that file is being evaled
- Handle eval for form under cursor (#'cider-eval-sexp-at-point is not an option)
- Use C-o/C-i to go back and forward cursor position (#'evil-jump-back is weird)
- After using project find with SPC-*, allow to filter by another search (like fzf in vim)
- Find a better terminal emulators alternatives
- Use tab to autocomplete suggestions popup
- Eval files after saving them
