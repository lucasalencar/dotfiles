# Dotfiles

Initial configuration for my development enviroment.

Totally based on [Holman's approach](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

##Setup

### Setup git configuration

1. Copy gitconfig file

```bash
cp git/gitconfig.symlink.example git/gitconfig.symlink
```

2. Fill it with your information

```
```

Before running, change git/gitconfig.symlink.example to gitconfig.symlink and fill it with your information.

## Using

To run, just execute install.sh contained on the root folder of the project.

**Be careful: it will override any configuration file existent on your user folder.**
